# Product Management API

## Project Overview
The **Product Management API** is a Spring Boot-based RESTful web service designed to manage products efficiently. This application provides a structured way to store, retrieve, update, and delete product data while ensuring scalability and ease of use. It is ideal for e-commerce platforms, inventory management systems, and product catalogs.

## Objectives
- Provide a simple and efficient API for managing product-related data.
- Ensure data consistency and integrity through proper validation and error handling.
- Implement secure and scalable RESTful endpoints.
- Offer seamless integration with databases and front-end applications.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot
- **Build Tool:** Maven
- **Database:** (Specify the database used, e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, H2)
- **ORM:** Spring Data JPA
- **Other Tools:** Lombok, Swagger for API documentation

## Product Data Model
The application follows a structured data model for handling product information.

### Product Entity
```java
@Entity
public class Product {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private String description;
    private Double price;
    private Integer stock;
    
    // Getters and Setters
}
```


### API Endpoints
| Method | Endpoint          | Description                |
|--------|------------------|----------------------------|
| GET    | `/products`      | Get all products          |
| GET    | `/products/{id}` | Get a specific product    |
| POST   | `/products`      | Add a new product         |
| PUT    | `/products/{id}` | Update a product         |
| DELETE | `/products/{id}` | Delete a product         |



## Implementation Details
- **Spring Boot Framework:** Provides rapid development capabilities with minimal configuration.
- **Spring Data JPA:** Simplifies database interactions and object-relational mapping.
- **Exception Handling:** Uses `@ControllerAdvice` for centralized error handling.
- **Swagger Integration:** Allows easy API documentation and testing.
- **Lombok:** Reduces boilerplate code for model classes.



## Additional Features
- **Pagination & Sorting:** Implemented using Spring Data JPA.
- **Validation:** Uses `@Valid` annotations to enforce constraints on request payloads.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** (If applicable, mention JWT, OAuth, etc.)

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Product-Management-API.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Product-Management-API
   ```
3. Build the project using Maven:
   ```sh
   mvn clean install
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```sh
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
5. The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing:** JUnit and Mockito are used for testing service and repository layers.
- **Integration Testing:** Performed using Spring Boot Test framework.
- **Postman Testing:** API endpoints are tested using Postman.



## Demo Instructions
1. Start the application.
2. Use Postman or Swagger UI to test endpoints.
3. Perform CRUD operations and check responses.
4. Inspect the database to verify stored data.


## Challenges Faced & Solutions
### Challenge 1: Handling Concurrent Updates
- **Problem:** Multiple users updating the same product leading to data inconsistencies.
- **Solution:** Implemented optimistic locking using `@Version` annotation.

### Challenge 2: Managing Large Datasets
- **Problem:** Fetching large product lists affecting performance.
- **Solution:** Implemented pagination using `Pageable` in Spring Data JPA.

### Challenge 3: API Security
- **Problem:** Unauthorized access to product data.
- **Solution:** Used JWT-based authentication and role-based authorization.
